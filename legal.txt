This PPtP driver for OS/2 is freeware. Nobody is making a profit with 
this software. Christoph Theis (theis@aon.at) from Austria ported this software
from Linux and created a modified version of xf86sup.sys. 
He can not be held responsible for any kind of direct or indirect damage
that you get by using this software. I (Roderick Klein) distribute 
this software via my website and can also not be held responsible 
for any damages. 

To state it even simpler: You use this software completely at your own risk!!!

Now for some people which are afraid this software will "blow" up there 
computer. Is has been tested with succes and people have encountered 
no crashes.

But still you use it at your own risk!

The Linux sources where released under GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 
(see the file "copying" in the directory pptplinuxos2port for details).
So this software is also covered by the GNU license.
